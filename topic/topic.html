    <h2 class="title" id="1">What is it?</h2>

    <p> Node.js is a free, open-source environment runtime that allows JavaScript to run on a server. It is used to build back-end services or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that power client applications.</p>
    </section>

    <aside>
         Node.js runs on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac OS.
        <br><br>
        Examples include a Web App running inside a web browser or a mobile app running on a mobile device.

    <p>As Node uses asynchronous programming, it can handle common tasks such as opening files on the server and then returning the content to the client faster than other runtimes by eliminating the waiting time during system opening and reading a file, and instead simply continues with the next request. </p>

        <img src="images/node_architecture.jpg" alt="Node.js single thread can handle multiple requests"><figcaption>Node.js' asynchronous technology</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    
    <p>In contrast, runtimes with synchronous programming, such as PHP and ASP, must return the content to the server before the request for the next file can be placed.</p>

    <figure class="images">

    </figure>

    <p>Node is ideal for building highly scalable, data-intensive, real-time applications that power client applications. It is great for prototyping and agile development and creating super-fast and highly scalable services. Additionally, Node applications use JavaScript, and as such, it allows for a cleaner and more consistent codebase when used alongside JavaScript. Node also has the largest ecosystem of open-source libs allowing the developer to focus on constructing the core of the applications rather than building the whole thing from the ground up. </p>

    <h2 class="title" id="4">The creator</h2>

    <p>Ryan Dahl initially released Node.js in May 27, 2009. His inspiration for developing the runtime arose from the problem he faced when trying to update a progress meter on a web page used for uploading files with Ruby web servers. At a glance, a truly simple task, which however required a truly complex solution.</p>

    <section class="paragraph">
    <h2 class="title" id="5"> Node.js governance</h2>
    
    <p>The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the main governing body responsible for the Node.js repo, as well as its projects, however, it ususally delegates these projects to working groups including the LTS group, Website, Streams, Build, Diagnostics, i18n, Evangelism, Docker, Addon API, Benchmarking, Post-mortem, Intl, Documentation, and Testing.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="paragraph">
    <h2 class="title" id="6">The dominance of Node</h2>

    <p>There are several stats which claim Node.js' rise to dominance over the past couple of years. Such is the graph below which depicts the runtime’s dominance in the IT world as of 2019.</p>

    <figure class="images">
        <img src="images/node.js_for_enterprises.png" alt="Node.js enterprise dominance chart"><figcaption>The dominance of Node.js in the IT world as of 2019</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The skill to work in Node has also become very sought after in the eyes of tech giants when seeking applicants to their job advertisements, as depicted by the Indeed Job Trends chart found below.</p>

    <figure class="images">
        <img src="images/node.js_job_trends.png" alt="Node.js job trends chart"><figcaption>Popularity of Node.js as outlined by Indeed Job Trends</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>While the chart only shows and compares the growth of the jobs requiring the individual’s knowledge in the specific coding language not the absolute number, it is still a good indication about Node.js’ tremendous growth over all other technologies.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="paragraph">
    <h2 class="title" id="7">The future of Node</h2>

    <p>While most experimental technologies receive their momentum during their startup phase, Node has appeared to diverge from this trend by established companies adopting the technology, such as Netflix, NASA, PayPal, Uber, Twitter, Yahoo and eBay.</p>
